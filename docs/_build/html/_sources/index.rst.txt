Astro3Words: easy coordinates in astronomy
================================================

Hi! Welcome to the documentation of Astro3Words -- a Python package to find 
`what3words <https://what3words.com/pretty.needed.chill>`_ coordinates of astronomical sources.

If you've ever been confused by endless J01234.567+012345 object names in talks and posters, or
bored of jokes about their beautiful names, you are not alone. Coordinates don't have to be so
difficult!

Astro3Words converts an R.A, Dec coordinate into three words - with a precision of 0.1". It's easy!
Our goal is to help astronomy outreach and make astronomy more accessible. We encourage the 
rest of the community to use our package and get involved. If you find a bug, or have a suggestion,
please `create an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/astro-nova/astro-3-words/issues>`_.
